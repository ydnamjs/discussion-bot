# Discussion Bot

This is a discord bot meant to track and award points for discussions in an academic discord server much in the same way that some websites do

The goal is to have it utilize discord's forum channels and assign points based on starting and responding to threads

The request for this bot comes from Nazim Karaca and as such the features will be designed as he specified which can be seen below:

# Instructors should be able to:

-   define requirements for posts and comments to earn points (character length, paragraph count, and having links)
-   award additional points to posts that generate comments
-   give awards and penalties to posts and comments that students make through discord reactions
-   define custom periods of time with their own score limits and goals
-   get the scores of every student (overall and by score period) in a csv document

# Students should be able to:

-   see their own points per score period
-   be notified when posts or comments dont meet requirements
-   be notified when posts or comments recieve an award or penalty
-   be able to easily see the rules of the discussion scoring
